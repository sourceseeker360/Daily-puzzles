Hello World!

Welcome to my repository! My name is sourceseeker360, and I'm a 
complete beginner at Python programming. I'm on an exciting journey
to learn and grow, one step at a time.

My Goal

My primary objective is to:

* Consistently create daily puzzles that are simple yet engaging.
* Use these puzzles as a learning tool for myself and others who are
  also new to Python.

What to Expect

* Beginner-friendly Python puzzles and challenges.
* A growing collection of scripts with clear explanations and comments.
* Encouragement to share your own solutions and ideas!

Feel free to follow along, suggest ideas, or solve puzzles with me. Let's grow together as coders!

Happy coding,
sourceseeker360
